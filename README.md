# IceCream
A website that allows a user to order an ice cream dessert.


I was tasked to create a website that allows a user to order ice cream with 2 choices --Cup or Cone.

If a user selects cup they can select some toppings to enjoy, if a use selects cone they will not be able to select ANY toppings only 4 scoops MAX
